             + born, 
             issp
             )
summary(model5)


#' Interpretation
#' 
#' Interviewees with primary-level education do not differ (substantively or    
#' statistically) in their monthly earnings from those with no educational degree.
#' 
#' Interviewees with tertiary-level education in a technical field earn, on 
#' average, 182 Euros more than those with no educational degree. However, the
#' effect is not statistically significant at the 5 percent level.
#' 
#' Interviewees with a university degree earn, on average, 1010 Euros more than 
#' those with no educational degree. The difference is statistically significant 
#' at the 5 percent level.

# changing the base category for education variables to "primary":
summary(lm(income ~ height

           + born, 
           issp
           )
        )


#' Interpretation
#' 
#' Interviewees whose father holds a university degree earn, on average,
#' 319 Euros more than interviewees whose father only finished primary school.	
#' 
#' Note
#' 
#' Both models are equivalent. They merely differ in the choice of base category, 
#' i.e., the level of eduaction to which the other levels are compared in terms 
#' of income.



## Visual display of the effect of education

# Saving the above graph as a pdf file

# Open a connection to a pdf file

#   This creates a pdf file and sets the size of the graphics region (in inches). 
#   Every plot we subsequently produce is written directly into this file until
#   we close the connection.

par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
ce.plot(model5, educ, xlab = "Education", ylim = c(350, 2400))
ce.plot(model5, feduc, xlab = "Father's Education", ylim = c(350, 2400))

# If output does not say "null device", repeat this command until it does



## Testing for overall significance of father's education

library(lmtest)      # this requires that package lmtest is installed

# H0: all coefficients of father's education are equal to zero
# H1: at least one coefficient is not equal to zero

# fit a model without father's education 
reduced <- lm(income ~ height 
              + gender 
              + weight 
              + age 
              + I(age^2) 
              + educ 
              + meduc 
              + born, 
              data = model.frame(model5)
              )

# Note that the reduced model must be estimated on the same sample as the full 
# model. This can be achieved by restricting the sample to those observations 
# that were used in the estimation of model 5 (i.e., the "model.frame" of model 5).

# F-test of H0
waldtest(model5, reduced)

# The difference in model fit is statistically significant at the 5 percent 
# level. We can reject the null hypothesis that all coefficients are equal to 
# zero and conclude that father's education has a significant effect on income.

## Exercise 6

# Consider your analysis of the effects of birth year and gender (independent 
# variables) on body height (dependent variable) from Exercise 5.

# 1. Include mother's education as a control variable for upbringing in the  
#    regression. Create the variable in exactly the same way that we've done 
#    in Session 6.
# 2. Change the base category for mother's education to "secondary".
# 3. Test whether mother's education has a significant effect on body height 
#    (i.e., test the null hypothesis that all coefficients of mother's 
#    education are zero).
